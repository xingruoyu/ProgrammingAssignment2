## This is the programming assignment from Coursera R course
## The assignment aims two create two functions that caches the inverse of a matrix 

## 1st function makeCacheMatrix 
## makeCacheMatrix takes one argument, x, which is a matrix
## This function creates a special "matrix" object and store it.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  inv <- NULL # define vector to store the caching inversed matrix
  
  set <- function(y){ # define set function that can define matrix x
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL # make sure that this vector is cleared when function is used again
  }
  
  get <- function() x # define "get" function that gets the contents of matrix x
  # look for the value of x outside the function environment
  
  set_inv <- function(inversion) inv <<- inversion 
  # define matrix "set_inv" that calculates the inversion of matrix x
  # look for the value outside the function environment
  
  get_inv <- function() inv #define matrix "get_inv" that gets the inversion of matrix x
  # look for the value outside the function environment
  
  # organize the set/get functions into a list, and give the variables headers
  # output of this function
  list(set=set, get=get, set_inv=set_inv, get_inv = get_inv)
  
}


## 2nd function cacheSolve
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  inv <- x$get_inv()
  
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("get cached inversion data")
    return(inv)
  }
  
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$set_inv(inv)
  inv
  
}
